Welcome to the Melon C language library. This library contains many algorithms, data structures, functional components, scripting languages and practical frameworks, which can facilitate developers to quickly develop application functions and avoid the dilemma of repeated wheel building.

### Platform Support

Melon was originally written for UNIX systems, so it is suitable for UNIX-like systems such as Linux and MacOS. And there are a few optimizations for Intel CPUs.

At present, Melon has also completed the preliminary porting to Windows, so it can be used on Windows. However, because Windows differs greatly from the UNIX system in the creation process, some functions of the above `framework` are temporarily not supported in Windows.
